Attacker

Now that you've defended your planet, go on the offensive and attack the aliens on their home turf.

Destroy their defending forces while you abduct aliens on each world.  Once you've captured all the aliens, you win the round.

When you're carrying an alien your ship moves much slower.  The goal is to bring the alien up to your mothership which appears at the top of the screen when you pick up an alien.

Controls
